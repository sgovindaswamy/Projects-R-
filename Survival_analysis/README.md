## SURVIVAL ANALYSIS

# Kaplan Meier Curves
This is parametric model which assumes that the underlying data distribution or the statistic is normally distributed. This is a time-event analysis technique. It analyzes the probability of occurrence of event over time. y-lab denotes the probability of event of interest to occur while x-lab denotes time. The curves begins at the highest probability of 1 and drops down stepwise at the occurence of an event ( For example, a patient leaving the cohort, deadth and so on ). 

Advantages

1) Used for Exploratory Data analysis or for univariate analysis

Disadvantages

1) It doesn't consider other predictor variables or other risk factors while modeling
2) It assumes the data is normally distributed
