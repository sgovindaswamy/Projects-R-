# GLIOMA CLINICAL TRIAL ANALYSIS

# Dataset
Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the brain. They can be graded as LGG (Lower-Grade Glioma) or GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) depending on the histological/imaging criteria. Clinical and molecular/mutation factors are also very crucial for the grading process. Molecular tests are expensive to help accurately diagnose glioma patients. In this dataset, the most frequently mutated 20 genes and 3 clinical features are considered from TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM brain glioma projects.
